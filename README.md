# Shopping Cart App

## Overview
The Shopping Cart App allows users to add items to a cart and apply various types of coupons to get discounts. The application maintains the sequence of items and coupons added to ensure accurate discount calculations.

## Features
- **Type 1 Coupon**: Percentage off each individual product in the cart.
- **Type 2 Coupon**: Percentage off the next product in the cart.
- **Type 3 Coupon**: Fixed amount off a specific Nth product of a specific type.

## Cart Calculation Examples
- **Cart #1**:
  - Items: `$10 postcard sorter`, `$20 stationery organizer`
  - Coupon: `Take 10% off the next product in the cart`
  - Total: `$10 - $1 (10%) + $20 = $29`

- **Cart #2**:
  - Items: `$10 postcard sorter`, `$20 stationery organizer`
  - Coupon: `Take 10% off the next product in the cart`
  - Total: `$10 + $20 - $2 (10%) = $28`

- **Cart #3**:
  - Items: `$10 postcard sorter`, `$10 postcard sorter`
  - Coupons: `Take $2 off your 2nd postcard sorter`, `25% off each individual item`, `10% off the next item in the cart`
  - Total: `($10 * 0.75) + (($10 - $2) * 0.75 * 0.90) = $7.50 + $5.40 = $12.90`

## Implementation Details
- **Coupon Types**: Enumerated using `CouponType`.
- **Coupons**: Implemented using the `Coupon` interface.
  - `PercentageOffEachCoupon`
  - `PercentageOffNextCoupon`
  - `AmountOffNthCoupon`
- **CartItem**: Represents an item in the cart with its type, price, and discount status.
- **ShoppingCart**: Manages the items and coupons, maintains their sequence, and calculates the total price.

## Usage
```java
public class ShoppingCartApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart();

        cart.addItem(new CartItem("postcard sorter", 10));
        cart.addCoupon(new AmountOffNthCoupon(2, 2, "postcard sorter"));
        cart.addCoupon(new PercentageOffEachCoupon(25));
        cart.addCoupon(new PercentageOffNextCoupon(10));
        cart.addItem(new CartItem("postcard sorter", 10));

        System.out.println(cart);
    }
}
```
